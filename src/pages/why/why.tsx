        <h2>My Journey: From UI/UX to Design Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Ricky, a design engineer at Mintlify. My journey
          started as a UI/UX designer at Mosaic, a 3D printing startup, where I
          tackled the challenges of creating user interfaces for various IoT
          devices. This experience ignited my curiosity about the technical
          aspects, leading me to become a UX engineer at RBC AIOps team, and
          eventually, a design engineer at Mintlify.

        <h2>The Magic of Blending Design and Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          As a design engineer, I wear two hats â€“ designer and coder. The seed
          was planted when I read about{' '}
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/google-design/google-maps-cb0326d165f5"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Prototyping a Smoother Map
          </a>{' '}
          when I was in school. I was fascinated by the idea of being at the
          intersection of design and engineering.
        </p>
        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Solving Complex Problems:</strong> At Mosaic, I designed UIs
            that could scale across various IoT devices with different screen
            sizes and pixel densities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating Impactful Tools:</strong> One of my proudest
            achievements was creating a comprehensive design system that
            standardized design elements and streamlined the development
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pushing Boundaries:</strong> At RBC, I worked on AI-driven
            operations tools, reimagining traditional workflows with my hybrid
            approach.

        <h2>How This Approach Helps Teams</h2>
        <h3>Bridging the Gap</h3>
        <p>
          As a design engineer, I act as a translator, helping both designers
          and engineers understand each other better.
        </p>
        <h3>Faster, Better, Stronger</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> My dual skill set allows me to
            quickly turn ideas into testable concepts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality Boost:</strong> I focus on details that make
            products feel polished, from smooth animations to efficient code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tools and Systems:</strong> The design system I created
            became a valuable resource for both designers and developers.
          </li>

        <h2>Collaborative Workflow and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          As a design engineer, my role bridges design and engineering,
          fostering collaboration throughout the product development process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Idea Validation and Prototyping:</strong> I work with
            designers to rapidly transform concepts into functional prototypes,
            considering both aesthetics and technical feasibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iterative Design Process:</strong> Collaborating in both
            Figma and code, I help push design boundaries while ensuring
            technical viability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engineering Consultation:</strong> I advise on
            implementation costs, component reusability, and web-specific
            interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality Implementation:</strong> Working with engineers, I
            focus on creating reusable components, optimizing performance, and
            ensuring accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design Systems Development:</strong> I contribute to
            building cohesive design systems that streamline work for both
            designers and developers.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This collaborative approach ensures that our final products not only
          look great but also perform exceptionally well, maintaining design
          integrity while proactively addressing technical challenges.
