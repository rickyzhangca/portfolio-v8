          <h2>My Journey: From UI/UX to Design Engineering</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Ricky, a design engineer at Wealthsimple on design
            system team. My journey started as a UI/UX designer at Mosaic, a 3D
            printing startup, where I tackled the challenges of creating user
            interfaces for various IoT devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience ignited my curiosity about the technical aspects,
            leading me to become a UX engineer at RBC AIOps team, and
            eventually, a design engineer at Mintlify, then Wealthsimple - my
            dream company making my favorite product.

          <h2>The Magic of Blending Design and Engineering</h2>
          <p>
            As a design engineer, I wear two hats â€“ designer and coder. The seed
            was planted when I read about{' '}

            </a>{' '}
            when I was in school. I was fascinated by the idea of being at the
            intersection of design and engineering.

          <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Solving Complex Problems:</strong> At Mosaic, I designed
              UIs that could scale across various IoT devices with different
              screen sizes and pixel densities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating Impactful Tools:</strong> One of my proudest
              achievements was creating a comprehensive design system that
              standardized design elements and streamlined the development
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>See my work being used:</strong> I love to see my work
              being used by others and making an impact. At the end, a great
              experience is only great when it's being used by others.
