      <h2>What got me here?</h2>
      <p>
        The seed of blending design and engineering was planted in the school
        when I read about{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        by a Google's UX engineer. I was fascinated by the idea of being at the
        intersection of design and engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey started as a UI/UX designer at Mosaic, a 3D printing startup,
        where I tackled the challenges of creating user interfaces for various
        IoT devices. At the same time, teams like Vercel and Linear started the
        design engineering trend.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience ignited my curiosity about the technical aspects,
        leading me to become a UX engineer at RBC AIOps team, a design engineer
        at Mintlify, and then Wealthsimple - my dream company making my favorite
        product. The design system team enabled me to fully leverage my
        multi-disciplinary skills. It also pushed me further with. I learned and
        shipped features in React Native, iOS, and Android.

      <h2>What is design engineering to me?</h2>
      <p>
        Design engineering has always been changing. To me, it is about making
        designs happen and delivering experiences in their best form.
      </p>
      <p>
        I often just tell people I am a designer, because engineering is my tool
        to design. I code a lot because it is often a better way to design, just
        like chefs picks the right knives based on the ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I jump between code and figma very often based on the needs. I code a
        lot to untangle the technical uncertainty, get prototypes for people to
        try, and ship things. I explore in Figma when the problem is open-ended,
        and when creativity is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I further wrote down where I see the future of design engineering here.

      <h2>Why make things beautiful?</h2>
      <p>
        Because good software should be beautiful. It is the natural outcome of
        solving problems and taking care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details and craftsmanship are a glimpse into the creator's passion and
        dedication. It is a reflection of the creator's commitment to excellence
        and a desire to create something meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chase of delights proves the love and sacrifice went into our
        beliefs - for the benefit of user's experience. And because that, look
        and feel is the quickest to way to tell the quality of the software and
        make users trust it.

      <h2>My values</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Ship things:</strong> I enjoy and celebrate the shipping
          moments. I sometimes make fancy graphics just for myself/my team as a
          ritual.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterative approach:</strong> I break things into chunks and
          improve iteratively, enjoying the small wins, rather than go back and
          forth for a long time, losing momentum.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep it simple:</strong> I am a simple person and I think from
          other people's perspective because I want to keep things simple for
          others too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Openess:</strong> I am a deep believer of the open flow of
          information. I share my thoughts, findings, questions, and ideas. I
          share as much as often as possible. I post a lot in chats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remote first:</strong> Commuting and distract myself at the
          office is meaningless attribution. The same energy should be used to
          build beautiful things. I work full-speed in my quite room.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Care about work:</strong> I care about the work I do, because
          life is short and I want to make the most of it by creating and
          building what I believe in and will be proud of.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <div className="prose w-full max-w-full rounded-2xl bg-white p-3 text-start md:p-8">
      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Ownership on problem areas:</strong> I love being the owner of
          a problem area - structuring the plans, and leading the way to a
          solution. A good degree of ownership creates strong motivation and
          sense of accomplishment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creating impactful tools:</strong> I love empowering others.
          Creating better UX and DX for internal teams is exciting. One of my
          proudest achievements was creating Mosaic's design system that is
          still used till today.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seeing my work being used:</strong> I love to see my work
          being used by users or other designers/engineers, and making an
          impact. At the end, a great experience is only great when it's being
          used by others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ambitious team that keep things simple:</strong> I love
          thinking about the big picture and where we could go next. Being free
          from corporate environment allows the team to look ahead, discover and
          solve problems without attrition.
